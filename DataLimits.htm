  <b>MAILING LABEL DATA LIMITS:</B>
  <BR><I>Please read carefully to minimize the amount of return mailings.  Generated mailing lists are to be used for City of Tacoma business only.</i>
  
  <br><br><b><u>TAXPAYER</u> - <I>Contains all taxpayers (<font color = "red">Most Accurate</font>) </I></b>
  <br>Mailing address of taxpayer is maintained by Pierce County Assessor-Treasurer.  This choice will produce the least amount of returned mailings.
  <br><br>Any related parcels, such as condos or group accounts, will also be included in the selection.  The parcels used to find the related parcels will have "REFERENCE" listed as Taxpayer.  Please double-check "REFERENCE" parcels at the <a href="https://epip.co.pierce.wa.us/CFApps/atr/epip/search.cfm">Pierce County Assessor</a> web site. 
  
  <br><br><b><u>OCCUPANT</u> - <I>Does not contain every occupant</I> (<font color = "red">Least Accurate</font>) </b>
  <br>Physical site address maintained as a GIS database by the City of Tacoma.  Occupants are selected by either contained with the buffer (Occupant Only) or within the parcel (Taxpayer & Occupant). No estimation on current completeness or when data will include every address in Tacoma.
  This choice will usually produce more returned mailings than the Taxpayer option due to the varying accuracy of the data (Commercial areas tend to be the least accurate). 
  However, if you would like to know more about this option and its level of accuracy for your specific area please contact Nancy Grabinski-Young (591-5394 or ngrabins@cityoftacoma.org) in the Tacoma Community and Economic Development Department for assistance.
  
  <br><br><b><u>DUPLICATES</u> - <I>How Are Duplicates Removed? What do I need to do?</I></b>
  <br>1. If only one choice is made (Taxpayer Only or Occupant Only), duplicates are removed where the address field match exactly. 
  <br>2. If more than one choice is made (Taxpayer & Occupant), duplicates are removed within a group as described in 1. Between groups a second removal of duplicates occurs where occupant (site) address equals taxpayer address (Occupant label removed). 
  <br>3. Duplicates may still remain due to any slight differences in spelling and format of names and addresses. The list that is created should be closely reviewed for duplicates. The list can be sorted by name and/or address during mail merge to determine which labels are truly duplicates and deleting them.
